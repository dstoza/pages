*This is part of the [FXM Project][fxm-overview]*

## Who you gonna call?

This blog has moved from a self-hosted instance of [Ghost][ghost] to [GitHub
Pages][github-pages]. I decided to do this because I spent a couple of days
putting together a long status update and a document on the FXM ISA and posted
them to my site earlier this week. After I restarted my machine for some
routine maintenance, the two new posts were gone. The post I wrote over a month
ago was still there, so it wasn't a total data loss, but it seems like the
posts were in memory somewhere but never got flushed to the on-disk database.

As much as I liked the Ghost platform, if it's going to drop stuff on the floor
without warning, I'm going to go elsewhere. With Pages, I can keep all my stuff
in a GitHub repo and trust that I can reboot my machine without losing stuff,
since there's a copy in The Cloud. It's a shame, though, because the realtime
Markdown preview was slick.

## So where was I...

Since I wrote the [first post]({% post_url 2014-04-11-the-fxm-project %}) in
this series, I've changed my mind about a few of the features I initially
listed.
